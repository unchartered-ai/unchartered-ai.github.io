    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        UncharteredAI is a competition that aims to benchmark the performance of embodied agents in open world environments. The competition will focus on evaluating the agents' ability to navigate, interact, and adapt to dynamic and complex scenarios. Participants will be provided with a set of tasks and challenges that require the agents to demonstrate their capabilities in real-world-like situations.
        The competition will consist of multiple tracks, each designed to test different aspects of the agents' performance. Participants will be required to submit their agents' code and a detailed report describing their approach, results, and insights gained from the competition. The best-performing agents will be recognized and awarded prizes.
        The competition will be held in conjunction with the NeurIPS 2025 conference, and the results will be presented at the conference. This is an excellent opportunity for researchers and practitioners to showcase their work and contribute to the advancement of embodied AI.
        The competition will be open to all researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts in the field of AI and robotics. Participants are encouraged to form teams and collaborate on their submissions. The competition will provide a platform for knowledge sharing and networking among participants.
        The competition will be held in a virtual environment, and participants will be provided with the necessary tools and resources to develop and test their agents. The competition organizers will also provide support and guidance throughout the competition.
        Participants will be required to adhere to the competition rules and guidelines, which will be provided in detail on the competition website. The competition organizers reserve the
        right to disqualify any participant who does not comply with the rules or engages in unethical practices.
