    <h2>Participate</h2>
    <p>
    Teams will register through our competition website, where they will gain access to a starter container 
    that includes the simulation environment, task definitions, baseline code, and documentation. 
    Participants will also be required to create an account on the competition platform 
    (we are currently evaluating platforms, including AWS-hosted solutions). 
    The platform will host the leaderboard, manage submissions, and oversee the competition workflow.
    </p>
    <br>

    <p>
    The competition will consist of three phases:
    <br>
    <br>
    <u><b>Warm-up Phase</b></u>: A dry run allowing participants to test the submission pipeline, 
    explore the starter container, and help organizers identify potential issues early on.
    <br>
    <br>
    <u><b>Development Phase</b></u>: Submissions during this phase will be evaluated on a public leaderboard. 
    Daily and weekly submission limits will be enforced during the development phase.
    Development Phase:} 
    <br>
    <br>
    <u><b>Final Evaluation Phase</b></u>: Participants will submit their final agents for evaluation on a number 
    of previously unseen tasks in an unseen test environment to determine the final rankings.
    <br>
    <br>
    Code submission will be required from top-performing teams for reproducibility and verification. 
    To support the community, we will host a Slack workspace (with a possible extension to Discord) 
    to provide real-time support, answer questions, share updates, 
    and encourage collaboration throughout the competition.
